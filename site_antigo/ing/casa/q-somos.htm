SHORT HISTORY OF CASA DE CINEMA</font></font></b>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/casa/casa1.gif" height=98 width=117 align=LEFT>
Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre was created in December 1987, by a group
of filmmakers who had been working together since the early Eighties, in
the south of Brazil.
<p>In its first phase, Casa de Cinema was a cooperative formed by 11 filmmakers,
gathered in 4 different production companies, who came to share a space
where they worked on the distribution of their films and also on the planning
and production of their projects.
<p>In 1991, Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre became an independent production
company, with 6 members, maintaining the cooperative spirit and the intention
of continuing to distribute and publicize the films produced by the original
group.
<p>In its 17 years' existence, Casa de Cinema has produced dozens of films
and videos, and also television programs (teledramas and series), courses
and workshops on screenwriting and introduction to filmmaking, discussion
forums and TV programs for political campaigns.
<p>Our partners and clients include television broadcasting companies such
as brazilians TV Globo and RBS TV, british Channel 4 and german ZDF, the
Rockefeller and the Macarthur Foundations, the distribution companies Columbia
and Fox, the Brazilian Landless Peasants' Movement (MST), the Workers'
Party (PT) and the Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB).
<p>Owing to the talent and skill of its members and collaborators, Casa
de Cinema is now a fundamental reference in contemporary Brazilian cinema,
confirmed by the many prizes awarded to Casa de Cinema productions at national
and international film festivals.
