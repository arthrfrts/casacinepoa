<p>SUMMARY OF THE PROJECT
<p>Documentary about the life and work of artist Iber&ecirc; Camargo. It
covers over five decades of artistic production. His work spans over the
entire twentieth century.
<p>A map of the artist’s work, made using the catalogue of his works from
the Iber&ecirc; Camargo Foundation and on the books already published,
will be the basis for capturing the images from collections belonging to
different institutions, private collections, galleries and at the Foundation
itself.
<p>Testimonies by his widow, friends, critics, academics, historians, artists,
models, writers, curators and collectors will be interspersed with images
of the most significant works from each phase of the artist’s production
and with archive images, where he reveals his creative process in painting.
<p>Besides his pictorial work, Iber&ecirc; Camargo produced short stories
and autobiographical writings, some of which were published. He kept a
correspondence with friends and other artists, which is a source of information
to help translate his personal and artistic history.
<p>Based on the publications No andar do tempo, Gaveta dos guardados, Conversa&ccedil;&otilde;es
com Iber&ecirc; Camargo, Correspond&ecirc;ncia com M&aacute;rio Carneiro,
Di&aacute;logos com Iber&ecirc; Camargo and other manuscripts never published,
we will reconstitute excerpts and narratives, where the thoughts of the
man and the stance of the artist in relation to the world and to his time,
prove to be intertwined.
<p>Both man and artist are obsessed with the material of memory.
<p>DESCRIPTION OF THE NARRATIVE STRUCTURE
<p>The narrative structure is established by taking a plunge into the material
of memory and into the archeology of the pictorial gesture of the artist
Iber&ecirc; Camargo, a painter in the expressionist strand of modern Brazilian
art..
<p>Different phases of his work will be related to events in his life with
his wife Maria Coussirat Camargo.
<p>We follow his formative years and the time when he established himself
as an artist: from his childhood in Restinga Seca, his hometown, going
through Santa Maria, Porto Alegre, Rio de Janeiro, the time he spent in
Europe in the forties, and then his return to Porto Alegre in 1981, where
he lived until his death in 1994.
<p>We will establish a dialog between his journey and the journey of twentieth
century Brazilian art, covering over five decades of restlessness and artistic
production.
<p>A man of his time, totally involved in his painting, he became one of
the greatest artists of modern and contemporary Brazilian art.
<p>In his relentless creative quest, he starts painting with words: he
writes fiction and reflections on art. Some of these literary passages,
which inspired the poetic narratives in the film’s timeline, will be adapted
in the film.
<p>His presence will take place through the use of archive images – on
film, video and photographs – and through his voice, extracted from interviews
he gave. The artist’s creative process and his unrelenting search for communication
will lead us to an archeology of images through the material of memory.
