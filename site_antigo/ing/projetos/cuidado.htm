Children&#8217;s DVD directed by Ana Luiza Azevedo<br>
        <br>
2006&#8217;s first release on Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre&#8217;s online store
will be wholly dedicated to children. Many of them are already big fans
of the theater and music work of the Cuidado que Mancha group. The
musicals "A Mulher Gigante" (The Giant Woman), "O Natal de Natanael"
(Nathanael&#8217;s Christmas) and "A Fam&iacute;lia Sujo" (The Dirties) is
now available on DVD. Full shows, with lyrics for you to learn and sing
along. Children love it and, if you don&#8217;t know it, here&#8217;s your chance.<br>
        <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">A MULHER GIGANTE / The Giant woman</span><br>
  </p>
  <p><img src="../../imagens/filmes/mulhergi.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 250px; height: 203px;" align="right">"The
Giant Woman" basically reproduces the book/CD created by the group,
stimulating creativity and interaction with the audience, reading and
the possibilities offered by music. The show has flashy costumes and
stage settings. Twelve of the CDs songs are performed vibrantly and
visually.<br>
  <br>
The musicians alternate their original functions with acting out the
characters in the album, a process which helps the show&#8217;s dynamics, so
as to put viewers always on the edge of their seats, guessing who will
be the next character to start singing and what story he will be
telling.<br>
  <br>
The musical also has participation by puppets who give life to the
songs on stage (among them, the Giant Woman herself, over ten feet
tall).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>

  <span style="font-weight: bold;">A FAM&Iacute;LIA SUJO / The Dirties</span><br>
  </p>
  <p><img src="../../imagens/filmes/fam-sujo.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 250px; height: 188px;" align="left">A
Fam&iacute;lia Sujo (The Dirties) is about a family not too fond of
cleanliness. S&eacute;rgio Dirty (the father) and Sula Dirty (the
mother) live moments of confusion when the couple&#8217;s daughter,
S&iacute;lvia Dirty, gets lost amidst the dirt.<br>

Stage direction by Mirna Spritzer and Raquel Grabauska. Cast direction

O NATAL DE NATANAEL</span> <span style="font-weight: bold;">/ Nathanael&#8217;s Christmas</span><br>
  </p>

  <p><img src="../../imagens/filmes/natanael.jpg" title="" alt="" style="width: 250px; height: 188px;" align="right">Nathanael&#8217;s
family is just like any other. Well, almost like any other. Every
Christmas night, something comes up and Nathanael&#8217;s father has to go
out in a hurry.<br>
  <br>
Nathanael has an idea for a gift: asking Santa that his father spend
Christmas night with him. Hopeful, the boy waits for December 24th, but
something else comes up and once again his father tells him he can&#8217;t
spend Christmas night with the family.<br>
  <br>
Saddened and tired of the situation, Nathanael has another idea. He
decides to follow his father and spend Christmas night with him, even
if he can&#8217;t see him, even if he has to hide from him. From that moment
on, Nathanael will live the greatest adventure of his life.&nbsp;<br>
