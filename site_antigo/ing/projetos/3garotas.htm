<br><b><font size=+2>(Three girls and an ET)</font></b>
<br>a feature film by Carlos Gerbase
<br>screenplay being developed
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>SYNOPSIS
<p>A young man about to drown in a small lake in Farroupilha park (Reden&ccedil;&atilde;o),
in Porto Alegre, is saved by two girls who had been jogging around there.
They take him to the apartment they share with a third girl. The boy is
weak, he cannot remember anything and has no documents on him. His clothes
are in tatters.
<p>After he recovers, he says he is from another planet. He tells his story:
he was sent by a beam of energy, produced by the telepathic capacity of
the inhabitants of his world – to research life on Earth, particularly
the use of technology on Earth. Depending on his report, his civilization
may (or may not) continue their plans of technological “involution”, eliminating
writing.
<p>Of course, they do not believe him, but they decide to keep him a while
longer in their apartment. From then on, the boy gets into several conflicts
with the city environment, which is strange to him and, sometimes, very
hostile. The behavior of the supposed ET is enigmatic and&nbsp; paradoxical:
he knows a lot about important things (philosophy and technology) and almost
nothing about trivial things (the difference between grains of rice and
beans).
<p>One of the girls has a farm in the countryside, and the four of them
go there sometimes to chill out and have a more “natural” life. The boy
eventually gets involved with the three girls, who are very different from
one another, but they are all in love with him.
<p>After a few weeks, he announces that it is time for him to do his report
and that this report will destroy his energy – in other words, that he
will die (and that is no drama for him). They try to convince him not to
do it (they are still not convinced that he is telling the truth). But
he must do it. He asks to be buried in the farm, and that they must not
tell anyone that he has died. He simply “went away”. They promise to do
as he asked. He goes into a trance, and, in spite of the girls’ efforts
to save him, he dies.
<p>They bury him in the farm. A few days later, the police arrives, along
with the boy’s mother (and his photo). She tells the story: her son was
a young, brilliant student, a specialist in the works of Heidegger and
Flusser. It took a long time to find out what he had done, but now, with
the help of the Internet, they finally managed. They disinter the body.
It actually is him. The girls get into trouble for having concealed a body.
<p>His mother tries to make the accusation lighter. Almost simultaneously,
the three girls discover that they are pregnant and decide to have abortions.
In order to prevent a tragedy, the mother reveals: she is also from another
planet and she has come on a mission to “erase the signs” of her son’s
passage on Earth. But she cannot allow her grandchildren to die. They do
not believe her. The mother says she can prove it.
<p>At the farm, the four women form an energy chain and get in touch with
the boy’s planet. The youngest one decides to go there and disappears in
a ray of light. The mother dies because she used up all her energy making
contact. The two other girls have their babies, a girl and a boy, who are
the seeds of a new civilization, the fruit of the union between two planets.
