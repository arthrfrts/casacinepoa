<td align="left" valign="CENTER">Chico, a teenager on vacation at the "longest
and worst beach in the world ", meets Roza at a games arcade and falls
in love. They make love on the night they first meet, but she vanishes.
Along with his friend Juca, Chico looks for Roza on the beach, in vain.
Only later, already back in the city and his organic chemistry classes,
does he meet her again. Chico wants to talk about &#8220;that night&#8221;, but Roza
tells him that she is pregnant. Before next summer, she will be getting
in and out of his life many times.&nbsp;

</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-zeroh.jpg" height="20" width="113">""If
you are a teenager or have just come out of adolescence, you will recognize
yourself in TWO SUMMERS. (...) This entertaining romantic comedy deals
with the sexual initiation of two friends, Chico, the protagonist and narrator
of the story, and the pragmatic Juca. While Juca is willing even to pay
for sex, Chico goes searching for his first love when Roza disappears the
morning after they make love on the beach &#8211; as director Furtado said, mentioning
Shakespeare&#8217;s characters, his script is about a Romeo in love with a Lady
Macbeth and whose friend is a Falstaff."
<br>(Ticiano Osorio, ZERO HORA, Porto Alegre, 19/Apr/2002)
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-jcpa.jpg" height="20" width="106">"The
filmmaker has, from his first works, (...) sought to couple emotion with
social criticism, entertainment with reflection. (...) In his first feature
film, Furtado allows us a glimpse into his future work: a cinema that elects
the character as main element, and through it seeks to reflect on our reality.
(...) The protagonist, experiencing a moment in his life, is, in reality,
becoming a character of an unwritten play, when he begins to act according
to the designs of his first passion. That is what distinguishes the film
from a superficial comedy. The story is about teenagers who know little
about the world, but it also highlights what reality itself, through &#8220;playacting&#8221;
&#8211; Furtado&#8217;s cleverest find, as he also wrote the screenplay -, gradually
teaches the main character."
<br>(Helio Nascimento, JORNAL DO COMERCIO, Porto Alegre, 26/Apr/2002)
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-abcd.jpg" height="20" width="120">"The
first great find of the film is the almost documentary form that Furtado
utilizes to tell the story of Chico, Roza, Juca, Violeta and Carmem. As
it is shot with a digital camera, there is total mobility of action, doing
away with fake sets in the style of Globo TV soap operas. (...) The characters
talk and act the way they really are, like teenagers, trying to administer
the activity of their hormones, the need for sex, the search for a relationship
more stable than a one night stand. (...) For all those reasons, TWO SUMMERS
has a very particular local feel."
<br>(Goida, ABC DOMINGO, Novo Hamburgo/RS, 28/Apr/2002)
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-zeroh.jpg" height="20" width="113">"Whoever
saw it liked it. A lot. TWO SUMMERS (...) grabs conquers grown-ups and
teenagers who recognize themselves on the big screen, in the adventures
experienced by the teenage trio Chico-Roza-Juca on the beaches of the Northern
coast of the state of Rio Grande do Sul. (...) After seeing the movie,
we all leave the theater with a feeling of having accomplished something.
Furtado and his team, for having made an entertaining and moving film,
that brings generations closer together, and us, spectators, adults and
teenagers, for having enjoyed a film that moved us and brought us closer
together. All of us, city people from the south of Brazil."
<br>(Fernando Mascarello, ZERO HORA, Porto Alegre, 04/May/2002)
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-folha.jpg" height="20" width="150">"What
matters is that everything is light, quick and fun, and the dialogues delightful.&nbsp;
A humanist look, both ironic and tender, at the teenagers of Porto Alegre
and of the whole world. (...) The digital video not only gives agility
to the narrative but also an interesting chromatic treatment and texture
to the image, that acquires a peculiarly nostalgic atmosphere, as if the
film regretted the fugacity of those green years, about to become past.
In the same way, the choice of a young cast with little or no experience
gives the characters a freshness and vitality that would be hard to achieve
with more experienced actors. The sound track is another find: songs that
made their mark in the sixties and seventies, rerecorded specially for
the film by new artists and bands. (...) Generations pass, but the idea
of youth remains intact. This is the feeling communicated by TWO SUMMERS,
with talent and tenderness."
<br>(Jose Geraldo Couto, FOLHA DE SAO PAULO, S.Paulo, 13/May/2002)
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-epoca.jpg" height="20" width="60">"LOVE
SEES FAR: The first feature film of Brazil's most important director of
short films is unpretentious but wise. (...) The actors stand out for their
truthfulness and the images captured on digital camera contribute to the
poetic atmosphere. But the strongest point is the generosity with which
he treats his characters. Furtado never slips into a moralistic posture,
he never judges young girls of questionable character and he stays well
away from the vulgarity of American teen comedies. (...) The director's
wisdom is in showing that not only is love not blind, but it sees the essence
behind the actions. It sees far enough to detect beauty in persons behaving
in ways that common sense would deem reprehensible."
<br>(Cleber Eduardo, Revista EPOCA, 02/Sep/2002)
<br><font size="-2"><a href="http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Epoca/0,6993,EPT380780-1661,00.htm">http://revistaepoca.globo.com/Epoca/0,6993,EPT380780-1661,00.htm</a></font>
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-estad.jpg" height="20" width="145">"There
is a beauty in this unpretentious film that is perhaps in the background,
and it involves the actual nature of the act of love. No one is realistic
when in love. When you manage to be objective, it is because the passion
is gone. When your loved one disappoints you, what happens is not that
you start telling yourself lies. This would be very simplistic. You start
to develop an elaborate type of thought process, perhaps delirious, which
will consist in attributing hidden reasons and motivations for the acts
of your beloved, in such a way that these acts come to be, if not excusable,
at least understandable. And thus you will maintain the belief in the predictability
of your beloved's acts, and feed the hope in the future. When this mechanism
falls apart, that is a sign that the passion has passed, like summers pass."
<br>(Luiz Zanin Oricchio, O ESTADO DE SAO PAULO, 06/Sep/2002)
<br><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.estado.estadao.com.br/editorias/2002/09/06/cad028.html">http://www.estado.estadao.com.br/editorias/2002/09/06/cad028.html</a></font>
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-folha.jpg" height="20" width="150">"HOUVE
UMA VEZ DOIS VER&Otilde;ES (TWO SUMMERS) succeeds in portraying teenagers,
their doubts and anxieties with irreverence and truthfulness. Furtado builds
characters whose merit is their apparent normality. They are young people
without any affectation or labels stuck on their foreheads, ordinary people
you could meet anytime anywhere. (...) Instead of technological pyrotechnics,
Furtado made use of other weapons: a well structured screenplay, with subtle
humour, and a classical way of shooting, secure, without any big inventions."
<br>(Guilherme Werneck, FOLHATEEN, Sao Paulo, 16/Sep/2002)
<br><font size="-2"><a href="http://www.uol.com.br/fsp/folhatee/fm1609200215.htm">http://www.uol.com.br/fsp/folhatee/fm1609200215.htm</a></font>
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-veja.jpg" height="20" width="36">"Stop
for a moment and think. How many times has Brazilian cinema produced films
for the teenage audiences? Perhaps due to this deficiency, the beguiling
HOUVE UMA VEZ DOIS VER&Otilde;ES (TWO SUMMERS) is like an oasis in the
desert. (...) With its colloquial language, juicy dialogues and rocked
to the underground sound of Wander Wildner, Ultramen and Sombrero Luminoso,
among other southern rock bands, the film's only pretension is to amuse
the spectator for just over an hour. And it succeeds."
<br>(Miguel Barbieri, VEJA SAO PAULO, 01/Oct/2002)
</p><p><img src="../../imagens/logos/lg-globo.jpg" height="20" width="108">"HOUVE
UMA VEZ DOIS VER&Otilde;ES (TWO SUMMERS) does not suffer from the intellectual
anaemia that is so typical of current teen movies, while at the same time
it is healthily pop. (...) This rather short film (it is just over one
hour and ten minutes) stands out due to its excellent script and the very
funny dialogues that keep well away from any clich&eacute;s. Furtado says
the actors collaborated in creating the characters."
<br>(Jefferson Lessa, O GLOBO, Rio de Janeiro, 10/Jan/2003)
