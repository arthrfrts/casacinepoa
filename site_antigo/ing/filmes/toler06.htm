<br><b><font size=+1>TREATMENTS OF THE SCREENPLAY</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Between October and December 1995, Carlos Gerbase wrote
the first treatment of “Tolerance”, which was very different from what
would eventually be filmed in 1999. It was finished on Dec. 12th 1995.
“J&uacute;lio”, a Journalism graduate, taught writing in a high school.
“M&aacute;rcia”, his wife, a lawyer, worked for an NGO linked to the homeless
movement. “Tiago” (now “Teodoro”), who also worked for the NGO, was a friend
of the couple. “Anamaria” was one of J&uacute;lio’s students and she worked
at the nursery school where “Guida” (a 2 year old child, J&uacute;lio and
M&aacute;rcia’s daughter) went. This was the screenplay registered at the
National Library and the basis for the fund raising. Gerbase wrote a second
treatment in ’97, making a few changes.</font>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/filmes/toler10a.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=163 width=250 align=LEFT><font size=+1>But
the fourth treatment, written in July/August ’98, already in collaboration
with Jorge Furtado and &Aacute;lvaro Teixeira, saw significant alterations
in its dramatic structure and in the characters. Although the central idea
was maintained, more action was added to the screenplay. “Guida” was no
longer a baby, but a 17 year old teenager. “Anamaria” became her friend,
also studying for the university entrance exams. “Teodoro” became a leader
of the landless movement. “J&uacute;lio” became a photo editor in an “adult”
magazine. This treatment was submitted to the competition for the RGE –
State Government Prize and was one of the three projects awarded.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The sixth treatment, of February ’99, contains the changes
made by Gerbase during the summer vacation. Basically, the dialogs were
revised and all the scenes involving M&aacute;rcia and Teodoro were re-written.
The seventh, eighth, ninth and tenth treatments, all written in March ’99,
mark the start of Giba Assis Brasil’s collaboration on the script. The
main modification was that the character “Teodoro” ceased to be a leader
of the MST (Landless Movement) to become a small farmer litigating with
the owner of the lands where he works and lives, and the murder mystery
involving him became more sophisticated.</font>
<p><font size=+1>“Anamaria” became the manager of a rock band, where Guida
is a guitarist. The eleventh treatment, written in April ’99, is the definitive
screenplay (it was the one used for the shooting script).</font>
<p><font size=+1>During rehearsals some dialogs were altered, but no scenes
were added or suppressed.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The number of treatments (twelve) is the result of the
screenplay’s development through almost four years of work. But “Tolerance”
actually suffered “only” three major changes of direction during that period.
Had the first treatment (December ’95) and the last one (May ’99) been
filmed, they would have resulted in two completely different movies, although
the basic idea was maintained.</font>
