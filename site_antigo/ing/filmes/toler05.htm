<b><font size=+1>THE STORY</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>“Tolerance” is the story of a couple who see their theories
about sex and politics confronted with reality, discovering that neither
the world nor themselves are civilized enough yet. J&uacute;lio, 40, studied
Journalism, and in the 70s he dreamed of making images that would change
the world. But today he works as a photo editor in an “adult” magazine.
He has given up changing the world. All he wants is to touch it up a little.</font>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/filmes/toler15a.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=160 width=250 align=RIGHT><font size=+1>M&aacute;rcia,
38 year-old lawyer, dreamed of embracing causes that would change the world.
When she married J&uacute;lio she was certain that together they could
overcome any challenge. But the birth of Guida changed their plans, and
she ended up in a less idealist but more lucrative job. She has not given
up changing the world, but she hopes to earn some money while she tries.</font>
<p><font size=+1>J&uacute;lio and M&aacute;rcia’s apparent resignation
to a “normal” life, however, did not include overturning their agreement
about possible extra-marital activities. They always told each other they
were free to have relationships with other people. These relationships
never happened. Until now. M&aacute;rcia tells J&uacute;lio that she has
slept with Teodoro, a client of hers accused of murder. She says it has
only happened once, that it was meaningless. J&uacute;lio is rather upset,
but he accepts it. J&uacute;lio exercises his “Tolerance”.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Shortly afterwards, J&uacute;lio meets a friend of his
daughter’s, called Anamaria. Besides being very attractive, Anamaria seems
to be the embodiment of some of J&uacute;lio’s most secret desires. From
then on, the lives of J&uacute;lio, M&aacute;rcia, Anamaria and Guida change
forever, and their “Tolerance” will be put to test in practice.</font>
