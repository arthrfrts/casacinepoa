<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="MAITE"></a><b><font size=+1>Mait&ecirc;
Proen&ccedil;a, “M&aacute;rcia”</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>A well told story and a surprising screenplay. According
to Mait&ecirc; Proen&ccedil;a, these are the main ingredients that can
make “Tolerance” a hit. It was because of them and the multifaceted character
M&aacute;rcia that the actress decided to work on the film. “Everyone likes
a good story”, she says.</font>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/filmes/toler11a.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=165 width=250 align=LEFT><font size=+1>The
film’s protagonist, she says that her character’s personality is revealed
gradually. “M&aacute;rcia has a very strong bond with her family, although
it does not seem so”, she explains. Pragmatism, coldness, love and the
problems it originates characterize the lawyer J&uacute;lio’s wife, according
to Mait&ecirc;. Differently from M&aacute;rcia, the actress reveals that
she blows up quite frequently, “I don’t accumulate life’s little intolerances”.
Reminded of the open marriage issue, she says that it is “a mere detail
in the couple’s life, because the film brings many surprises”.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Besides the script and the character, she also thinks
that the production is very professional, without excluding friendship
or affection. “The Casa de Cinema is a team of friends who like each other,
they don’t just tolerate each other”, she comments, playing with the film’s
title. The actress points out that in Rio de Janeiro and S&atilde;o Paulo,
there is often tension around the set, and that in this shoot “the stress
is only circumstantial, there is no hidden tension eating up the humors”,
she concludes.</font>
<p><font size=+1>For Mait&ecirc;, the character is the most important,
whether you are playing it on television, on film or on the stage. Even
so, she believes that the Brazilian Cinema is not yet established as an
industry due to economic problems. “The concern right now should be to
form audiences for Brazilian films”, she analyzes.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="BOMTEMPO"></a><b><font size=+1>Roberto
Bomtempo, “J&uacute;lio”</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>While distributing autographs and smiles as he left the
set, Roberto Bomtempo found time to talk to his family on his cell phone
and to give us an interview. Roberto’s high spirits are certainly due to
the fact that he is working on a movie. “Film is my great passion”, he
reveals.</font>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/filmes/toler02a.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=172 width=250 align=RIGHT><font size=+1>The
36 year-old actor explains that his enthusiasm with the feature film “Tolerance”
is due to several factors. Among the most important ones are his admiration
for - and the resulting desire to work with - the team of the Casa de Cinema
de Porto Alegre – as well as his immediate empathy with the character J&uacute;lio.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Bomtempo mentions that he has mostly acted in films where
his roles required very strong characterizations, which is not the case
in the role of the photographer J&uacute;lio. “The coolest thing about
this character is that he is a normal guy”, he analyses. For the actor,
it is this supposed simplicity that presents the greatest challenge to
the actor playing the character: “I try not to “act”, but to think of his
feelings”, he ponders.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Talking about the character’s feelings, he tells us that
he had never done so many sex scenes on a film, but that did not make him
nervous. “The cold weather and the relaxed way Gerbase directs the scenes
stopped me worrying”, he says.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Besides acting, Bomtempo directs and teaches acting. He
recognizes that the theater is the greatest acting school, as you rehearse
for two months, and when the curtain goes up, it’s ready”. On the other
hand, film is a different process, it “requires concentration through a
certain period of time, making every little bit of a scene very important”,
he concludes.</font>
<p><font size=+1>After shooting “Tolerance”, which is his 22nd film, his
next project is a film adaptation of the play Dois Perdidos Numa Noite
Suja, by Pl&iacute;nio Marcos, which will be his first experience as a
film director. “I am very excited with the possibility of directing a film”,
he says. While he waits, the actor talks about Casa de Cinema’s film, “I
believe that it will reach a very wide audience, as it’s an erotic thriller.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="MARIA"></a><b><font size=+1>Maria Ribeiro
– “Anamaria”</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>The Casa de Cinema has the best screenwriters in Brazil.
They are hot”. With this comment, the actress Maria Ribeiro shows her enthusiasm
for being in the cast of “Tolerance”. The unpretentiousness and professionalism
of the producers have charmed Maria. She met them last year when she came
to the south along with her boyfriend, the actor Paulo Betti, and saw some
of the shoot of the mini-series Luna Caliente.</font>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/filmes/toler06a.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=162 width=250 align=LEFT><font size=+1>Cast
in the role of the sensual and intrusive Anamaria, she says this part is
very different from the “good girls” she has played on television. She
believes this character is a chance to change her image. According to her,
“it’s more fun to play roles that have nothing to do with you”.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The 24 year-old Scorpio reveals that she has had a traditional
upbringing, but to create the role of Anamaria she found inspiration in
friends of her and in women who seduce just for the sheer pleasure of it.
“If they find me a sex-symbol and that brings in the audiences to watch
the film, it will be great fun”, she answers with a smile.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Even so, she finds it difficult to do sex scenes and she
admits that in the beginning she was a little tense, but the good rapport
with and the tranquility of director and production put her at ease. Another
factor that helped in the preparation of those scenes was the cast itself.
“I’ve known Bomtempo for some years and he has helped me a lot”.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Maria’s praise does not go only to the team of the Casa
de Cinema, “where the hierarchy is subtle and everyone is treated equally”,
it goes also to the people of Porto Alegre in general: “here even taxi
drivers are more educated”, she says. Besides missing home, Maria’s only
complaint is the cold weather. For the scene where she bathes in the waterfall,
she intends to concentrate hard and forget the chilly wind that should
be blowing in the next few days.</font>
<p><font size=+1>The adaptation to the Porto Alegre accent is also going
smoothly. The actress appreciates the challenge, as it shows self-assurance
on the part of the Casa de Cinema team, “who do not surrender, but value
the land where they were born and live”, she explains.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="ANA"></a><b><font size=+1>Ana Maria Mainieri,
“Guida”</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>This expressive 20 year old, with auburn hair, awaits
for her orange juice at the Cataventos Caf&eacute; at the Casa de Cultura
M&aacute;rio Quintana. She has just finished one of her acting classes
in preparation for her work on the film “Tolerance”. Ana Maria smiles when
she talks to &Uacute;ltimas Not&iacute;cias about her expectations from
her first role on film. “I really believe in this film. I hope it is good
and that I can play my role as well as possible”. Ana tells us that the
screenplay attracted her because of the plot and also because it discusses
political issues, which greatly interest the actress from Porto Alegre.</font>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/filmes/toler05a.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=158 width=250 align=RIGHT><font size=+1>For
the actress, her role – Guida - is a “different teenager, but she is sweet,
perhaps even a little childish”, she explains, referring to the fact that
the character tries to call her father’s attention in some scenes. In order
to create the role of J&uacute;lio and M&aacute;rcia’s daughter, Ana revisited
her own past, searching for the adolescent that is inside each one of us.</font>
<p><font size=+1>According to Ana, the “harmony between direction and production”
is a positive aspect in the making of this film. She points out that it
is a privilege to work with the Casa de Cinema and with actors like Roberto
Bomtempo and Mait&ecirc; Proen&ccedil;a.</font>
<p><font size=+1>“Tolerance” is the first feature film in Ana’s career,
but she has been acting since she was 15 years old. Determined to work
professionally, she admits that her love for the profession leads her to
root for the success of the film. “It could be my passport to success”,
she says. Presently she is almost exclusively devoted to her work on the
film, although she has many plans for the future, even “taking a course
and even acting abroad”.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Asked about the limits of her “Tolerance”, the central
theme of the film, Ana says they are very broad. However, she ponders that
depending on the situation, the old popular saying – one’s freedom ends
where the next person’s freedom starts – is still valid.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="NELSON"></a><b><font size=+1>Nelson Diniz,
“Teodoro”</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Originally a stage actor, Nelson Diniz, 35, plays Teodoro
in “Tolerance”. He considers the character his first work on a feature
film, although he did play a small part in Anahy de las Misiones. Excited
with the possibilities of experimenting with film, Diniz says he really
values the experience in the medium, and he is certain that working with
the Casa de Cinema is a guaranteed learning experience: “The Casa de Cinema
are the most professional producers of Porto Alegre”.</font>
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/filmes/toler12a.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=160 width=250 align=LEFT><font size=+1>For
the Rio Grande do Sul actor, who starred in several shorts, like Paulo
and Ana Luiza in Porto Alegre and Two Films in One Night, among others,
“Tolerance” requires a longer preparation for his role, with more time
and situations to be examined and explored. According to him, when you
act in short films “you don’t get a chance to explore the character in
depth or to follow the development of the script”. Besides this “opportunity
to grow professionally”, as he points out, it is a pleasure to be working
with producers who treat everyone equally, without discriminating between
starring and supporting actors.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Diniz tells us that the screenplay interested him because
it dealt with the issue of the limits of relationships, be they romantic
or social. He explains that he was attracted to the question “up to which
point one is able to put in practice what one has decided to do in theory”,
as well as to the issues of “Tolerance” with your fellow human beings.
He also argues that Teodoro’s function is to present the land problem,
the abuse of power and the issue of the limits in rural properties.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Concerning his work preferences – film, theater or television
– Diniz admits that lately he has preferred film. As it is another kind
of acting, he believes that rehearsals are even more important because
scenes are shot out of order, so the actor does not have the preceding
scene as a point of departure. “Any movement you do is magnified on the
screen”, he points out. Even so, film is the only way the work of an actor
remains registered, for good or bad.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Diniz is excited with the new surge of local productions
and he argues that cinema cannot be reborn because it has never died. “What
was reborn was the interest in investing in films, so more pictures are
being produced now”, he points out. The actor stresses that it was not
just film production that has profited from the new public and private
investments, but all the arts. “The FUMPROARTE of the Porto Alegre City
Council enabled the realization of several theater productions.</font>
<p><font size=+1>In terms of “Tolerance”, he admits that his “Tolerance”
with his wife knows no limits, but “with Brazil it ended at least 5 years
ago”, he says, “or at least since the days of that president, I won’t even
say his name, but you know who he is”, he says with a superstitious smile
and draws two Ls in the air. But he immediately changes his tone, as if
to ward off ghosts, and returns to the film. “It is the first time I am
involved with a feature film from beginning to end”, he concludes, pleased
with his expectations from the movie. After shooting “Tolerance”, Nelson
Diniz will be shooting another feature, Netto Perde Sua Alma, and, if all
goes well, he will act in the play O Pagador de Promessas, which will be
staged on the steps of the Das Dores Church.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="FLU"></a><b><font size=+1>Flu – musical
director</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Straight from the world of images to the world of sounds.
Fl&aacute;vio Santos, a former bass player with the De Falla band, now
Flu, along with the guitarist Marcelo Fornazier (nickname 4Nazzo) are the
creators of the musical score of Casa de Cinema’s latest feature. Besides
the instrumental track, they have selected - along with director Carlos
Gerbase - songs by several bands that punctuate the film. A partner of
the audio production company Deff, Flu has recently released his solo album
with the recording company Trama, titled “…and the joy goes on”. He gave
us this interview.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>What is the work on the production of the score for
“Tolerance” like? Do you watch the scenes and then write the music? What
is the process like for the musicians?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>We (4Nazzo and I) always work with the image. It is crucial
to follow the director’s ideas. He knows the pace and the intention of
the scenes. We generally show him a few ideas and from then on we start
the final composition.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>In your opinion, what is the difference between the
work when you create the musical score for a film and composing in general?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>On a film score you work with images that are already
there, ready, and when you compose, the images are formed gradually inside
your head.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>Besides the original music that is being written by
you and 4Nazzo, you have chosen songs by bands and artists from Rio Grande
do Sul, like Dharma Lovers, Tom Bloch, Wander Wildner, J&uacute;piter Apple,
among others. How was the process of selection?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>We had a lot of good stuff to listen to and to choose
from, as we collected a lot of material from the bands. Gerbase made the
final selection.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>Did you see the filming of any of the scenes? From
the scenes that you saw, which ones most inspired you?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>I saw the mini-zoo scene at the park and some others at
the studio. I think the end with the revelations about the crime will be
the most instigating ones.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>How do you see the Brazilian pop/rock scene right now?
What about Rio Grande do Sul?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>Here in Rio Grande do Sul it has never been so good. The
best is that there is great variety of styles and a lot of character. Now,
with easier access to recording and releasing independent CDs, bands are
believing more in their own work and they are no longer dependent on the
interest of a big recording company.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>Your solo work has been very well received both by
the public and by the critics. How has it been received elsewhere in Brazil?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>They are still trying to define the kind of music I make.
Actually my music is for people who have a “child’s spirit”. Children and
women love it and have fun listening to my music.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>Fl&aacute;vio Basso started calling himself J&uacute;piter
Ma&ccedil;&atilde;, now J&uacute;piter Apple, you have changed your artistic
name to Flu. What is the reason for that? Is it numerology or marketing?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>My younger sister started calling me Flu in the mid eighties.
Then my girlfriends called me Flu. Then my mother started calling me Flu.
Now everyone calls me Flu.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>What are your projects for the next millennium?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>Besides producing the soundtrack for “Tolerance” here
at Deff/Reclame, 4Nazzo will produce next year’s great sensation: Fu Wang
Foo.</font>
<p><i><font size=+1>How far does your “Tolerance” go?</font></i>
<p><font size=+1>Up until a person says “this is how I am and I won’t change”.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="BRAGA"></a><b><font size=+1>Fl&aacute;vio
Braga and Lu&iacute;s Carlos Quintarelli – special effects technicians</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>Two special effects technicians came from Rio de Janeiro
with the paraphernalia necessary for the murder scenes. Fl&aacute;vio Braga
and Lu&iacute;s Carlos Quintarelli talked to us about this kind of work
in Brazil.</font>
<p><font size=+1>First, Quintarelli, 26, listed the effects being used
in these scenes: a gunshot in the body, a gunshot in the forehead and a
gunshot in the leg. He explained that for the gunshots they use a metal
plate to protect the actor. Inside this plate there is a preservative,
“a condom, filled with imported fake blood”, he says.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Besides the blood, they also insert in the plate an electric
detonator, which is set off by a switch plugged into a 9 Volt battery.
The technician also adds that the explosion can be “set off by remote control,
depending on the case”. What we see and hear on the screen is the explosion
and the noise, followed by smoke and blood flowing from the actor’s body.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But this team does not live off gunshots and deaths only,
they also do explosions, rain and thunder, as in the commercial for the
Mercedes Class A that is being shown on TV now. With 8 years experience
in the market, the team has worked in all soap operas produced by Globo
Television since Fera Ferida, besides specials like Xuxa and comedy shows
like Renato Arag&atilde;o and Casseta e Planeta. Their work in films includes
Bela Dona and O Cangaceiro, among others. This is the first time they work
with the Casa de Cinema.</font>
<p><font size=+1>But Braga, 28, thinks it is very complicated to work with
special effects in Brazil, as in most cases, the directors are in a hurry
and they want them to do just the most basic stuff. However, Braga says
that in “Tolerance” they are getting a lot of support from the director,
so they are able to experiment until they produce exactly what he wants.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="FIAPO"></a><b><font size=+1>Fiapo Barth
– art director</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>“The set design in “Tolerance” is urban and contemporary”.
For Fiapo Barth this was one of the factors that made it easier to define
the guidelines for the art direction of the film. Having participated in
the Casa de Cinema productions for 13 years, Barth – whose real name is
Antonio – has been working with Gerbase since the medium length film Deus
Ex-Machina and he says that “the crew is getting along really well”.</font>
<p><font size=+1>According to Barth, the studio allows greater flexibility
in composing and creating the sets. He justifies his preference for doing
art direction for the studio, as opposed to location. “You have to know
the location beforehand and to adapt to what is already there, while in
the studio you are a lot freer to create”, he concludes.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Fiapo, an architect, first became interested in set design
when he started designing sets for theater productions. Afterwards he designed
sets for commercials and for a program produced by the public television
of Rio Grande do Sul. He then got an invitation from the directors Jorge
Furtado and Jos&eacute; Pedro Goulart to work on a film. His first work
as an art director was on the short The Day Dorival Faced the Guard, directed
by Furtado and Goulart.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Out of all his work as an art director, he considers these
two his best work: A Matadeira (The Killer), by Jorge Furtado, “as it is
almost theatrical, it is the most noticeable for the audience”, he explains;
and O Pulso (Pulse), by Z&eacute; Pedro Goulart, “it is the most perfect
one, the richest one in details. I created a morgue in the style of The
X Files”, he says. Barth has also directed a short called O Trampolim.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Besides being an art director, Fiapo is also the owner
of the Ocidente bar, a traditional spot of the Porto Alegre nightlife for
almost two decades, located in the Bom Fim neighborhood.</font>
<p>
<hr SIZE=3 WIDTH="100%"><a NAME="ROSANGELA"></a><b><font size=+1>Ros&acirc;ngela
Cortinhas – Costume Design</font></b>
<p><font size=+1>“The costume design in “Tolerance” is really 1999”. That
is the comment of the costume designer Ros&acirc;ngela Cortinhas – R&ocirc;
– about the look created for the film’s characters. She explains that most
of the clothes were bought, but at cost price. She points out that this
kind of support given by some stores, deserve the production’s undying
gratitude.</font>
<p><font size=+1>Having created the costume design on several films, including
as Sexo &amp; Beethoven, Um Homem S&eacute;rio, Velho do Saco, R&ocirc;
says that she has not had any major difficulties in “Tolerance”, as it
requires a more contemporary look. She tells us that her most challenging
work was on the film A Matadeira, by Jorge Furtado, as it required period
costumes. Besides being a costume designer, Ros&acirc;ngela is also a screenwriter.
She has written Ventre Livre, directed by Ana Azevedo, and &Acirc;ngelo
Anda Sumido, by Jorge Furtado, among others.</font>
<p><font size=+1>R&ocirc; considers that the most complicated look to create
was that of the character M&aacute;rcia, “because M&aacute;rcia is not
your usual lawyer”, she says. According to the designer, from the clothes
they wear, we can see that the girl friends Guida and Anamaria are “happy
girls”. She says that when she went to the stores to buy the clothes, the
season’s fashion was full of grays and blacks.</font>
<p><font size=+1>“I’ve tried to create a colorful wardrobe for the girls”,
she clarifies. “Anamaria, for instance, wears many shades of green”. Ros&acirc;ngela
works with two assistants in “Tolerance”, Lica Stein and Cac&aacute;.</font>
