(23/Sep/2005)<br>
  <br>
SAL DE PRATA, a feature film by Carlos Gerbase, opens today in movie
theaters around the country, with over 30 copies. The premieres took
place September 12th in S&atilde;o Paulo and 23rd in Porto Alegre. The
film won the Best Film Editing award at the Thirty-Third Gramado Film
Festival.<br>
  <br>
SAL DE PRAT is a movie about movies. It shows us, through the story,
what making movies is like: Veronese is a failed moviemaker who owns a
photography supply store; he dates C&aacute;tia, an economist who works
in finance. She has no interest in movies, but a sudden turnaround
leads C&aacute;tia to explore the Veronese&#8217;s universe. Behind the human
plot, the film discusses the film-to-digital format move.<br>
  <br>
The cast is widely known: Maria Fernanda C&acirc;ndido, Camila Pitanga,
Bruno Garcia and Marcos Breda play the leading roles. Since all
characters are from Rio Grande do Sul (where the story takes place),
the actors were trained so there wouldn't be any accent problems. To
that end, Gerbase gave them CDs with dialogues recorded by actors from
the state.<br>
  <br>
Sal de Prata was shot in only two months, from July to September 2004.
Initially called "Screenplays Found in a Computer", the script was
rewritten several times before the final version was completed. The
images were shot in 35 mm and DV (Digital Video).<br>
  <br>
This is Carlos Gerbase&#8217;s fourth feature film. He has already released
INVERNO (Winter) (1983), VERDES ANOS (Green Years) (1984) and
TOLER&Acirc;NCIA (Tolerance) (2000), which was rated adults-only at the
time. It is Casa de Cinema&#8217;s fifth feature film, after Toler&acirc;ncia
(2000), HOUVE UMA VEZ DOIS VER&Otilde;ES (Two Summers) (2002); O HOMEM
QUE COPIAVA (The Man who Copied) (2003) and MEU TIO MATOU UM CARA (My
Uncle Killed a Guy) (2004), the last three by Jorge Furtado.<br>
