<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>The "Gerbase’s Essential Works" Festival, at the Santander Cultural
Center Cinema</b>
<br>(25/May/2004)
<p>In the last week of May, The Santander Cultural Center Cinema will be
showing the most important works by Carlos Gerbase, one of the directors
of&nbsp; Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre. Currently, as well as being coordinator
of the Audiovisual Production Course at PUC (Catholic University of Rio
Grande do Sul), Gerbase is also preparing his fourth feature, SAL DE PRATA
/ SILVER SALT (formerly "Screenplays found in a computer"), which he will
start shooting in the second semester this year. And, while they wait for
his next feature, audiences will have the opportunity to see and discuss
significant examples of his audiovisual production.
<p>From May 27th, the festival "Gerbase’s Essential Works" will be showing
the features
<br>INVERNO / WINTER, VERDES ANOS/GREEN YEARS and TOLER&Acirc;NCIA / TOLERANCE,
six shorts (INTERL&Uacute;DIO, PASSAGEIROS, AULAS MUITO PARTICULARES, O
CORPO DE FL&Aacute;VIA, DEUS EX-MACHINA and SEXO &amp; BEETHOVEN O REENCONTRO),
as well as three TV productions (O AMANTE AMADOR, O COMPRADOR DE FAZENDAS
and FAUSTINA).
<p>It is Verdes Anos' anniversary! On May 25th 2004, it will be 20 years
since its commercial release, on May 25th 1984. A special session, opening
the season GERBASE’S ESSENTIAL WORKS, on Thursday 27th at 8 PM will bring
together the film crew, the directors Carlos Gerbase and Giba Assis Brasil,
actors and technicians.
<p>Gerbase will be present on another two occasions: at a chat with the
audience after INVERNO, and at the closing of the festival, with very special
guests for a Session of Analysis of his films.
<p>During the Festival, there will also be a STILL PHOTOS EXHIBITION, from
several films, made by Gerbase.
