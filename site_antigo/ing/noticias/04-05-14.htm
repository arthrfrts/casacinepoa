<p><b>The shoot of MEU TIO MATOU UM CARA / MY UNCLE KILLED A GUY begins</b>
<br>(14/May/2004)
<p>Jorge Furtado’s third feature film, MY UNCLE KILLED A GUY starts shooting
this Friday, May 14th 2004, in Porto Alegre. The film tells the story of
a teenager, Duca (Darlan Cunha, who played Laranjinha in “City of Men”),
and his friends Kid (Renan Gioelli) and Isa (Sophia Reis), as he tries
to help his uncle (L&aacute;zaro Ramos) who has been accused of murder.
Of course, Duca is in love with Isa, and she is in love with Kid. And of
course, uncle Eder’s crime has something to do with his girlfriend, Soraya
(Deborah Secco). The cast also includes Dira Paes (Kika, from “Amarelo
Manga”) and Ailton Gra&ccedil;a (Majestade, from “Carandiru”), playing
Duca’s parents.
<br>&nbsp;

and Paula Lavigne’s production company, Natasha Filmes, from Rio de Janeiro.
The executive production is by Nora Goulart and Luciana Tomasi, the photography

by Caetano Veloso. The shoot will last 6 weeks. The film will be released
