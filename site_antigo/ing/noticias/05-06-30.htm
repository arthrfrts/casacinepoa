  <br>
The results for the Programa Petrobr&aacute;s Cultural 2004/2005
(Petrobr&aacute;s Cultural Program 2004/2005) public selection were
released today and Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre received two awards
for support of feature film production: "Saneamento B&aacute;sico, o
filme" (Basic Sanitation: the Movie), by Jorge Furtado, and "Antes que
o Mundo Acabe" (Before the World Ends), by Ana Luiza Azevedo.<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;"Saneamento B&aacute;sico, o filme" (Basic Sanitation&#8230; the Movie)
is a political comedy about a small community of Italian-Brazilians in
upstate Rio Grande do Sul who resorts to making a video to try to solve
the village&#8217;s problems. "Antes que o Mundo Acabe"(before the world
ends) is based on the novel of the same name by Marcelo Carneiro da
Cunha. It tells the story of a teenager who discovers the world through
photography.<br>
  <br>
According to the contest&#8217;s regulations, Petrobr&aacute;s made an
invitation/homage to two directors who stand out because of past works
or a recent production. The Petrobr&aacute;s site informs that "Ana
Luiza Azevedo is the director invited by Programa Petrobr&aacute;s
Cultural to shoot her first feature film. Ana Luiza is known for making
short films since the late eighties, both as a writer ("O dia em que
Dorival encarou a guarda" (The day Dorival faced the guard)) and
co-director ("Barbosa"). Among her short films, she has directed "Dona
Cristina perdeu a mem&oacute;ria" (Dona Cristina lost her memory) and
"Tr&ecirc;s Minutos" (Three Minutes), which was part of the 1999 Cannes
Film Festival competitive section".<br>
  <br>
&nbsp;"Saneamento B&aacute;sico, o filme"(Basic Sanitation: the movie),
Jorge Furtado&#8217;s fourth feature film, was one of the 24 movies awarded
grants by the selection jury.<br>
  <br>
Rio Grande do Sul also had another feature film project awarded: "O
Homem Que Roubou o Mundo" (The Man who stole the World), directed by
Gustavo Spolidoro and produced by TGD.<br>
