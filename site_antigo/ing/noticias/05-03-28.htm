<p><b>The music for SILVER SALT will be recorded in a church</b>
<br>(28/Mar/2005)
<p><img SRC="../../imagens/noticias/orqulbra.jpg" HSPACE=10 height=167 width=250 align=LEFT>On
April 7th and 8th, at the Igreja das Dores, in the center of Porto Alegre,
the recording of music for the feature film Silver Salt, directed by Carlos
Gerbase and produced by Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre will take place.
The film’s musical director, conductor Tiago Flores, will be conducting
the 20 musicians of the Ulbra Chamber Orchestra, with special guests Fabio
Presgrave (solo cello), from Rio de Janeiro, and the Uruguayan musician
Carlito Magallanes (bandone&oacute;n).
<p>The soundtrack of Silver Salt, researched and chosen by Carlos Gerbase
and Tiago Flores, is based on classical pieces for strings from the Romantic
period (19th century), especially the works of Schubert, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak,
Mendelssohn, Nielsen and Grieg. The exceptions are two baroque pieces by
Bach and Vivaldi. The recording of the music will be taped live by three
cameras and will be part of the “extras” in the film’s DVD.
<p>The cast of Silver Salt includes Maria Fernanda C&acirc;ndido, Camila
Pitanga, Bruno Garcia and Marcos Breda. The film will be distributed in
Brazil by Columbia pictures and the film is planned to be released in September
this year.
<p>The filming of Silver Salt was done in six weeks, from July 29th to
September 8th 2004, in Porto Alegre. The film’s screenplay – originally
called Screenplays Found in a Computer – was selected to participate in
the Sundance Institute Workshop, held in Nogueira (Rio de Janeiro), in
2002. Between 2000 and 2004, the screenplay went through fourteen treatments
before arriving at its final version.
<p>Sal de Prata/Silver Salt is Carlos Gerbase’s fourth feature, after INVERNO/WINTER
(1983), VERDES ANOS/GREEN YEARS (1984) and TOLER&Acirc;NCIA/TOLERANCE (2000)
and Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre’s fifth: TOLER&Acirc;NCIA (2000, Carlos
Gerbase), HOUVE UMA VEZ DOIS VER&Otilde;ES/TWO SUMMERS (2002), O HOMEM
QUE COPIAVA/THE MAN WHO COPIED (2003) and MEU TIO MATOU UM CARA/MY UNCLE
KILLED A GUY (2004), the three latter by Jorge Furtado.
<p>This production was made possible through awards won in film project
competitions promoted by federal government bodies – ANCINE and BNDES,
both in 2003 – and the support of the companies Brasil Telecom, Dana Albarus,
Santander Banespa, Banrisul, Banrisul Corretora and Grupo Habitasul..
