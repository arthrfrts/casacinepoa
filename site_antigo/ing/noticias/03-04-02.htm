<p><b>TWO SUMMERS wins award in Paris</b>
<br><b>(02/Apr/2003)</b>
<p>On April 1st, the 5th edition of the Brazilian Film Festival of Paris
came to a close. The three awards given this year went to the films TWO
SUMMERS, by Jorge Furtado, which received the Professional Jury Prize,
"Uma Onda no Ar", by Helv&eacute;cio Ratton, which won the Popular Jury
Prize and the short film "&Agrave; Margem da Imagem", by Evaldo Mocarzel,
which received the Students’ Jury Prize of the Femis and Louis Lumi&egrave;re
schools.
<p>TWO SUMMERS was chosen unanimously by the jury formed by: Jacques Arlandi,
director of the Louis Lumi&egrave;re Film School; Christophe Jorg, programming
director of the cultural TV channel TV Arte France; J&eacute;rome Paillard,
marketing director of the Cannes Film Festival and Martine de Clermont-Tonnerre,
co-producer of the film Central Station. The actress J&uacute;lia Barth

<p>"The most surprising thing was the unanimous consensus established among
the members of both juries and the public about the award winning films",
observed French director Agn&egrave;s Jaoui (Le Go&ucirc;t des Autres),
when she referred to the enthusiastic applause the films received.
<p>Speaking for the feature film jury, Jer&ocirc;me Paillard, director
of the Cannes Film Market, and Christoph J&ouml;rg, responsible for the
film sector of the French-German TV channel Arte, explained that the choice
of TWO SUMMERS was due to the "exceptional qualities of the film, like
the simplicity, lightness, the consistence of the characters and sensitivity
in dealing with the delicate issue of teenage sexuality". Both specialists
were generous in their praise of the screenplay, the "powerful and precise
dialog", the "exemplary direction of Jorge Furtado, who proves to be an
outstanding filmmaker, with a highly promising future, also because he
manages to make brilliant movies such as this one with an insignificant
budget.".
