<p><b>TWO SUMMERS in New York</b>
<br><b>(15/May/2003)</b>
<p>Thanks to a joint initiative of the Rio Festival, the Brazilian Film
Festival of Miami, and MoMA (New York Museum of Modern Art), a program
of Brazilian films will be shown annually in the Big Apple, starting next
July. "The idea is to hold the festival always in the summer. In the next
two years, while MoMA is away from its permanent site on 53rd St. (currently
for renovation), the screenings will be at the Gramercy Theatre. There
are also open air screenings scheduled for Brooklyn and Central Park",
says Ilda Santiago, director of the Rio Film Festival, one of the people
heading the project.
<p>Brazil will be the second country to receive an annual focus from MoMA’s
film department (the only other country is Germany). "We intend to take
the films that had very limited or no exhibition in the United States,
using the experience and the contacts from the festival to attract professionals
in this market so that they can see these movies alongside the audiences",
says Ilda. The festival strengthens the ties between the festival and MoMA,
which has already organized retrospectives of restored American film classics
in Brazil, jointly with the festival.
<p>The first season is scheduled to be held between July 23rd and 28th,
with screenings of "Janela da alma", "Durval discos", "Edif&iacute;cio
Master", "Separa&ccedil;&otilde;es", "Dois perdidos numa noite suja", "Desmundo"
and HOUVE UMA VEZ DOIS VER&Otilde;ES (Two Summers) MoMA will pay for the
subtitled copies, the transport and the infra-structure of the event in
the city. Rio Festival will find new sponsors to take filmmakers and representatives
of each film, which would help to publicize the event. The proposal, according
to Ilda, is to expand the festival when MoMA returns to its home, within
two years, always maintaining film as its main focus, but also holding
exhibitions and music performances.
