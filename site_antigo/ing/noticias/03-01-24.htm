<p><b>TWO SUMMERS beats 007 in Rio</b>
<br><b>(24/Jan/2003)</b>
<p>The feature TWO SUMMERS is the big hit of the summer on the cinema screens
of Rio de Janeiro. The film has already been seen (until Wednesday, Jan.
1st) by 48,867 spectators and, in the second weekend in Rio, it had the
best average of all films on the movie theatres of Rio de Janeiro: 1087
spectators per theatre. The runner-up, "007 – Die Another Day", had 981
spectators per theatre. In order not to have to send viewers home, due
to sold out sessions, the cinema Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Botafogo moved the
film to its largest theatre.
<p>TWO SUMMERS and "007" opened simultaneously in Rio, but while the average
audience numbers for James Bond fell from 1580 to 981 spectators in the
second week (minus 32%), Chico, Roza and Juca saw their audiences go up
from 1058 to 1087 per theatre, taking the leading position. The movie is
still on in Rio and this weekend it should hit the 50 thousand spectators
mark.
<p>Columbia Pictures, the film’s distributor, attributes its excellent
box-office performance to good word-of-mouth publicity and the positive
reviews the film received from every newspaper in Rio. Andr&eacute; Sala,
national sales manager for Columbia, says: "out of all the cities in Brazil,
the film had its best performance so far in Rio. The average audiences
on opening night in Rio were higher than in Porto Alegre."
