<p><b>THE CAT has its premiere 18 years later</b>
<br>(15/Dec/2004)
<p>Filmed in S&atilde;o Jos&eacute; do Norte between March and April 1986
and in Porto Alegre in June 1988, The Cat, by Saturnino Rocha, is a medium
length film shot on 16 mm for film and television. With its complicated
production history, this movie finally reaches audiences now, almost two
decades after it was shot. Finished in digital, with funding from FUMPROARTE
(which paid for the dubbing, sound, mixing and the final copy), The Cat
will have its premiere on December 15th at the P.F. Gastal Cinema at Usina
do Gas&ocirc;metro. The film will then be shown from the 16th of December
every day at 3 PM, 4:30, 6:15, 7:30 and 8:45 PM.
<p>The story is set in the small town of Miramar, where the Cat arrives
on his bicycle, provoking jealousy in men and desire in women. But in the
year that Cat meets Doroti, the beautiful and faithful wife of Pedro, the
lighthouse keeper, the town’s daily life is changed forever. A nonsense
melodrama, a story of love and magic realism. The cast of The Cat includes
the actors Giusepe Orist&acirc;nio, Nora Prado, Carlos Cunha, Jos&eacute;
Baldissera, Ant&ocirc;nio Schmit, Salimen J&uacute;nior, Breno Ruschel,
Edu Madruga, Lui Strassburger, Hamilton Mosmann, D&eacute;bora Finocchiaro,
Cl&aacute;udia Meneghetti and M&aacute;rcia Erig. Additional voices by
J&uacute;lio Andrade, S&eacute;rgio Lulkin and Z&eacute; Ad&atilde;o Barbosa.
<p>Lasting 60 minutes, The Cat represents a unique moment in the cinema
of Rio Grande do Sul, which the audiences will finally be able to see.
