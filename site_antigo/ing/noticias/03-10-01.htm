<blockquote><b><font size=+2>Casa de Cinema News</font></b>
<p><b>Two Casa de Cinema productions at the National Festival of Globo
TV</b>
<br><b>(01/Oct/2003)</b>
<p>Globo TV has scheduled another edition of the NATIONAL FESTIVAL for
October, with only Brazilian films. This time two productions of Casa de
Cinema de Porto Alegre are in the program: LUNA CALIENTE, originally made
for TV in 1999, directed by Jorge Furtado and adapted from the novel by
Argentinean author Mempo Giardinelli; and TOLER&Acirc;NCIA, which opened
on cinema screens in 2000, directed by Carlos Gerbase, and written by the
director in collaboration with Alvaro Teixeira, Jorge Furtado and Giba
Assis Brasil.
<p>The miniseries LUNA CALIENTE had its 3 original episodes re-edited especially
for this screening, losing 40 minutes and gaining the dynamism of a feature
film. The cast includes Paulo Betti, Ana Paula Tabalipa, Paulo Jos&eacute;,
Tonico Pereira, Fernanda Torres and Bruno Garcia. In turn, the feature
TOLER&Acirc;NCIA transfers to television the whole power and controversy
of its 110 original minutes. The cast includes Mait&ecirc; Proen&ccedil;a,
Roberto Bomtempo, Maria Ribeiro, Nelson Diniz, Werner Sch&uuml;nemann and
Ana Maria Mainieri.
<p>Other films to be screened during the festival are XUXA REQUEBRA, EU
TU ELES and AMORES POSS&Iacute;VEIS. LUNA CALIENTE will be screened on
Globo TV, on Friday, October 10th. TOLER&Acirc;NCIA closes the National
Festival on Saturday 11th.
<p>The presence of the Casa de Cinema films in the special season broadcast
by Globo TV happens precisely when the production team of Casa de Cinema
begins to shoot the 5 episodes of CENA ABERTA, a series to be shown nationwide
by Globo TV in November and December.
