<p><b>THE SANDWICH wins American TV award</b>
<br><b>(06/Mar/2003)</b>
<p>THE SANDWICH, a short film made by Casa de Cinema de Porto Alegre and
directed by Jorge Furtado, has just received another award, this time in
the USA. The film was chosen among eighty shorts from all over the world,
as one of the five best shorts of 2002 and it will receive the Kodak Award.
THE SANDWICH was screened in the weekly program The Short List, on PBS,
which has an audience of around 10 million viewers. It is the first time
that a Brazilian movie wins this award, given by Kodak since 1998. This
is the film’s nineteenth award.
<p>Actually, the award could have been predicted in December, when an article
on the magazine INDEPENDENT FILM &amp; VIDEO MONTHLY, commemorating the
10th anniversary of the show The Short List, dedicated a special feature
to THE SANDWICH, citing it as "one of the most remarkable films shown this
year” and using the photograph of Milene Zardo and Felippe Monaco as the
main illustration for the text.
